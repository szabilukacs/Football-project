# âš½ Football Stats

A data engineering project that processes football match data from a raw CSV file, cleans and validates it, loads it into a **PostgreSQL** database, and prepares views for analysis. The processed data can be further visualized in **Power BI**.  

This project was created to gain experience with **data handling (240k+ rows), Docker, PostgreSQL, and data engineering workflows**.

## âš¡ Features
- Load football statistics from CSV (**240,000+ rows**).  
- Clean and validate raw data using **pandas**.  
- Insert teams and matches into PostgreSQL tables.  
- Automatically replace team names with IDs for consistency.  
- Create SQL **views** for easier data analysis.  
- Connect to **Power BI** for visualization.

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/szabilukacs/football-stats.git
cd football-stats
```

Create your .env file
```bash
DB_USER = ""
DB_PASS = ""
DB_HOST = ""
DB_PORT = ""
DB_NAME = ""
```

The script will:  
1. Load raw CSV data.  
2. Clean & validate it.  
3. Insert data into PostgreSQL tables.  
4. Create analysis-friendly views.  

After running, open **Power BI** (or another BI tool) to the PostgreSQL database and start building dashboards.
